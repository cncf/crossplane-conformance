# Crossplane Conformance

The Crossplane community continues to grow with new contributors, adopters, and vendors.  As the
diversity of the community and its needs has grown, a large ecosystem of extensions to Crossplane's
functionality, known as Providers, has also been established to provision and manage infrastructure
in a wealth of environments and scenarios. More than 20+ Providers have been published by the
community at large, with many more expected to be created over time.

Similarly, a need for Distributions of the Crossplane project has surfaced with its adopters.  As
there are many environments, marketplaces, and integrations in which adopters want to install and
consume Crossplane, there is a need for a variety of packaged bundles ("Distributions") to deliver and consume
Crossplane in these new targets.

With this diversity of Providers and Distributions, there comes a need for a consistent set of
expectations in their behavior and usage. To this end, a Crossplane Conformance Program has been
established as described in this repository, in order to give end users the confidence that when
they use a Certified Crossplane offering, they can rely on a high level of consistent and common
functionality.  This will enable the Crossplane community to continue to grow and thrive among both
vendors and adopters.

## Certification Types

Both Distributions of Crossplane as well as Crossplane Providers have a specific certification
process to follow to verify conformance with the program's expectations.  Further details on how to
verify and submit results for your conformant Distribution or Provider are available in the
[conformance instructions](instructions.md).

## Updates to the Conformance Program

This conformance program will evolve over time as the functionality of Crossplane itself evolves, as
well as the needs of the community continue to evolve. If you want to contribute ideas to improve,
extend, or update the conformance process, you are welcome to propose your desired changes by
creating an [issue in this repo](https://github.com/cncf/crossplane-conformance/issues).

## Applying for Conformance Certification

All vendors are invited to submit conformance testing results for review and certification by the
CNCF, which formally certifies conformant implementations.  Instructions for submitting conformance
results can be found on the [conformance instructions](instructions.md) page.

Certification is available for Crossplane versions 1.2 and higher.

## Benefits of Certification

In addition to providing confidence to end users of your Crossplane Distribution or Provider,
offerings that certify are able to:

* Proudly display the new Certified Crossplane logo mark on their marketing materials
* Use Crossplane in their product name by taking advantage of a new combination trademark rule the
  CNCF adopted for Certified Crossplane providers that keep up to date with their certification

## Recertification

To ensure the pace of innovation in Crossplane continues and benefits all users, Distributions and
Providers must complete a recertification each year for the current or previous version of
Crossplane to remain certified. This ensures that when you see the Certified Crossplane mark on a
product, you’re not only getting something that’s proven conformant, but also contains the latest
and greatest developments from the community.
